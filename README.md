SoulMusic lets users search for music for their own need.

For example, if users type in the prompt "I'm tired. Boost my energy up". SoulMusic will return music results that do just that.

Currently, the app is only distributed on Github Releases. Distribution on other platforms is in plan.

Plan for new features and releases: To be updated.
