SoulMusic is an Android mobile app that lets users search for music for their own need.

For example, if user types in the prompt `I feel lost. I don't know what to do. Give me clarity`, SoulMusic will return music results that do that at its best. The search performance of the app will be improved in later releases.

Users have the option to search for popular music or hidden gems (good but not very popular music).

Currently, SoulMusic returns 20 results at maximum for each search. In later releases, higher number of music results for each search will be supported.

Currently, the app is only distributed on Github Releases. Distribution on other platforms is in plan.

Most APIs the app uses have limited usage quotas. Higher usage quotas are being requested. In the mean time, please pardon if you happen to use the app when some quota limit has been hit. It will return error messages in those cases.

The app is in early stage so some edge cases haven't been handled yet. Those will be handled in later releases.

Plan for new features and releases: To be updated.
